 * @brief This class organizes requests for new Covers for the AlbumCoverView.
 * When looking for covers, not all requests should be fired simultaneously,
 * so there should be a buffer assuring that covers are found one by one.
 * Albums are organized by hashes, each album has a CoverLocation. A new
 * request is added to the queue by calling add_data(). A new request is
 * handled BEFORE old requests. The thread is locked until the done() function
 * is called. The thread emits the signal sig_next(). The cover location
 * and the hash which should be processed next can be fetched by current_hash()
 * and current_cover_location().
